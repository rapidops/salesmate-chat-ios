## Update Info.plist

#### Photo Library usage:

With the exception of apps that _only_ support iOS 14+, when installing SalesmateChatSDK, you'll need to make sure that you have a `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` entry in your `Info.plist`.

For apps that support iOS 13, this is [required by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1937/_index.html) to access the photo library. It is necessary when installing SalesmateChatSDK due to the image upload functionality. Users will be prompted for the photo library permission only when they tap the image upload button.

## Example app
There are example apps provided [here](https://github.com/salesmate/salesmate-chat-ios/tree/master/Examples) for Objective-C and Swift, as well as an example built with SwiftUI.
